You are to return the date, a gigasecond ahead from the date passed as an argument into the function.
You should return the date with its time at 00:00:00 (hh:mm:ss)

## Instructions

You should get familiar with *Date* javascript class, its formats, and the unix date integer.

Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work
towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make
it.
Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just
pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the
specification.

Have fun!
